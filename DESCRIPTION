Description: Integrated weight calibration tools with a modern, testable API.
    Provides Bregman-divergence (BD), generalized-entropy (GE), and Deville-Sarndal (DS)
    calibration under linear constraints, with structured solver diagnostics and
    extensible solver backends. This package is a refactoring and API redesign inspired by
    the GECal package.
